What is this Project?

This open source project came derived from Richard Summers within the Xojo forums. Richardâ€™s idea was to have a filmstrip image viewer that had nice features and was extensible. I took on this project for Richard as an example on utilizing the Xojo canvas in an OOP fashion.


Future version releases?

    This is an open source project and I will be adding to this implementation with more Core API calls as
    time permits.
    
I found a bug, what now?
